# Welcome to PrimerTK documentation

PrimerTK is a toolkit is a python package that has the capability to design standard primer sets, multiplex primer pools, and primer sets
around complex structural variants such as large deletions, insertions, translocation events, and inversions. 

PrimerTK is used in conjunction with [primer3](https://github.com/primer3-org/primer3) and [in silico PCR](https://hgwdev.gi.ucsc.edu/~kent/src/) to extract reference sequences by coordinate position, design primers, compare them with each other to check for pooling compatibility (if multiplexing), check for off-target products, and filter for the top results. It also has the ability to detect SNP's present in primers and annotate them in results.
